# Cybersecurity Learning Vault

This vault is organized for daily learning, quick capture, and clean publishable notes.

## Structure
- **01_Networking** — IP, DNS, OSI, routing, Wireshark basics
- **02_Linux_and_Tools** — bash, nmap, netcat, tcpdump, metasploit, burp helper notes
- **03_Web_Security** — OWASP Top 10, payloads, test cases
- **04_Pentesting** — methodology, recon → exploit → post-exploit checklists
- **05_Forensics** — memory/disk analysis notes
- **06_Malware_Analysis** — static/dynamic analysis notes
- **07_CTF_Writeups** — challenge write-ups and lessons
- **98_Templates** — reusable note templates
- **99_Inbox** — quick notes to sort later

## How to use
1) Keep **Learning_Log.md** open daily. Add short entries as you learn.
2) For each topic, create a note in the relevant folder using templates from `98_Templates/`.
3) Add things you want to backfill later to **Topics_to_Revisit.md**.
4) Commit & push with GitHub Desktop or the Obsidian Git plugin.

**Tip:** Avoid sensitive data in public repos (real IPs, creds, API keys). Keep a private repo for raw notes and a separate public repo for cleaned guides.
