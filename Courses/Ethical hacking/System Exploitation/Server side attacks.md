## 2025-08-13
**Setup :**  
- Creating a NAT network where both the VMs can be in the same server and can use internet.
- The IP range is 192.168.15.0/24 .
- Both the VMs should have different IP.
- The IP on the kali is 192.168.15.4 .
- The IP on the metasploitable is 192.168.15.5 .
- The default gateway is 192.168.15.1 .
  
**Commands/Tools practiced:**  
```
# Kali linux

`**ip r**`
default via 192.168.15.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 192.168.15.4 metric 100 
192.168.15.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.15.4 metric 100 
```

**Steps :**  
- Open both the VMs and make sure both of them has different IP.
- Open Zen map in kali to scan for open ports in the 192.168.15.5 (metasploitable).
- Do an intense scan 
- Port: 21/tcp, State Service : open ftp, Version : vsftpd 2.3.4 
- (Can also use version to check for the available exploits )
- Anonymous Ftp login is allowed ( Its written below the port 21/tcp)
- After this the file will be transferred and can be opened in the kali
- Commands :
```
`ftp 192.168.15.5` 
(Use anonymous as both login and password)
(Once it shows login succesfull and connected)
`dir`
`get <filename>`
`bye`
```

**How to create a txt file in metasploitable:**  
```
`sudo nano <filename.txt>`
(Write whatever you want to in the text)
Ctrl X < Y < Enter
```
