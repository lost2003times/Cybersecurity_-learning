## 2025-08-13
**Setup :**  
- Creating a NAT network where both the VMs can be in the same server and can use internet.
- The ip range is 192.168.15.0/24 .
- Both the VMs should have different ip.
- The ip on the kali is 192.168.15.4 .
- The ip on the metasploitabe is 192.168.15.5 .
- The default gateway is 192.168.15.1 .
  
**Commands/Tools practiced:**  
```
# Kali linux

**ip r**
default via 192.168.15.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 192.168.15.4 metric 100 
192.168.15.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.15.4 metric 100 

```

**Steps :**  
- Open both the VMs and make sure both of them has different IP.
- Open zenmap in kali to scan for open ports in the 192.168.15.5 (metasploitable).
- Do an intense scan 
- Port: 21/tcp, State Service
