### Encoding:
- Encoding helps transform data into another format.
- It is used for transmitting data over different protocols for ease of use.
- Example: transforming image data into base64 for transmission over web or converting video from one format to another.

### Encryption 
- Simply used for keeping data safe.
- Encryption is the process of turning a data into a unreadable format not of a fixed length. The unreadable data can be decrypted to display the original plaintext data with the help of the right key.
- Encryption can be symmetric/asymmetric and it relies on a key, methods used are AES/RSA.
- One of the unique advantages of asymmetric encryption using public key pairs is the ability to ensure both the security of encrypted messages and the identity of the sender.
- Example: Https protocol encrypts the connection between user and server.

### Hashing 
- Simply a way of validation data integrity.
- Useful when you want to verify bur not store data garbage value and make it irreversible and unreadable.
- Unlike encryption, hashing serves as a checksum to ensure that a particular piece of data or a file hasn't been altered. 
- Example: SHA1, SHA256, MD5
