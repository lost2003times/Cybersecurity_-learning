## 2025-08-18
**What I studied:**  
- Ensure you are not the victim of the MITM attack.
- Dont download files for the public network and if you are unsure then download using VPN and still if you are unsure then use the official websites only.
- Windows anti virus is good enough but still if you want to use a good antivirus then Malwarebytes and Bitdefender. 
- These are very much trusted and also they are light on resources.
- If you ever download files you can check the file on Virus total which will scan the file with multiple antivirus.
- If you have a big file which is not possible
