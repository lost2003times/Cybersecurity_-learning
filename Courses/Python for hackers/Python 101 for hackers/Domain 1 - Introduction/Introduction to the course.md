## What is Python?

- Dynamic, interpreted, object-oriented, high-level language
- Enables cross-platform rapid prototyping and scripting
- Relatively simple, easy to learn syntax
- General purpose and versatile, with a mature standard library
- Extensible, actively used with a large community

## Why learn Python as a hacker?

- Understand how scripts or proof of concepts work
- Debug, modify and run scripts or proof of concepts
- Create your own scripts or proof of concepts
- "Easy" first programming language for beginners
- Understanding how an application could work makes it easier to anticipate how it could break (you can also think about fixes too)

## Python2 vs Python3

- Python2 is no longer under development - but people still use it
- Python2 code will (mostly) not run in Python3 environment
- Python3 stores strings as unicode by default (not ascii)
- If you don't know how to run a script - try both (or try to print)
- If you have a choice - use Python3 (Python2 is End of Life)
