___
## Hard to completely prevent, but we can make it more difficult on an attacker:

### 1. Limit account re-use:
- Avoid re-using local admin password
- Disable Guest and Administrator accounts
- Limit who is a local administrator (least privilege)

### 2. Utilize strong Passwords:
- The longer the better (>14 characters)
- Avoid using common words
- I like long sentences

### 3. Privilege Access Management (PAM):
- Check out/in sensitive accounts when needed
- Automatically rotate passwords on check out and check in
- Limit pass attacks as hash/password is strong and constantly rotated
