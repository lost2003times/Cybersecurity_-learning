### Downloading Nessus :

First visit the Nessus download page and download the Linux Debian 64 bits (or something else according to your OS).
Then come to your Cmd :
```
cd Downloads
sudo dpkg -i Nessus(file)
```
Now it will download and then you will receive the command to start the Nessus so copy paste that and along with that you will receive a link with which you will be accessing the Nessus page.
For Example it looks like this but it will be different for different machines :
```
sudo /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service  
[Nessus](https://kali:8834/#/)
```

After that you have to Register/ Login and let the plugins to download because without that it wont work.
If there's an issue while downloading the plugins then you can use this code to force Nessus to download. 
```
sudo /opt/nessus/sbin/nessuscli update --plugins-only
```
After the plugins are downloaded you have to wait for them to configure so it will take sometime as well and then you can use the Nessus.

### First Scan :

For the first scan we will be scanning our Kioptrix machine using a "Basic Network Scan".
