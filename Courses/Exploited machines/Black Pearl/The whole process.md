- I start with the Nmap scan for the IP address 192.168.15.12 and I find out 3 open ports, 22/tcp open ssh, 53/tcp open and 80/tcp open.
- Port 22 is not gonna help to get root access remotely so i start my doing a directory search of on the port 80.
- There I find a hidden directory named secret and it was a txt file which said that there is nothing on this port so look for the root on different port dont waste time here.

- As we have the port 53 open as well we do a DNS recon and find out the url : 
http://blackpearl.tcm
- To use this url I open my hosts on kali :
- ```
  sudo nano /etc/hosts
  ```
- There I added the url and the IP address and i found this page

- I immediately searched for the available exploits for this and I found one which can be used in metasploit.

- These does help in gaining a shell but now I had to do the privilege escalation on the gained shell but first of all I made it look like a proper shell using TTY shell.

- Before using this I checked which python the shell had.

- Next step was to get linpeas running on the shell for that I setup the python server and used it to get linpeas on this shell.

- I changed the permission of linpeas so it can run.

- Then I tried to find the file which can help me get more access:

-  I opened the GTFObins and tried to match the SUID escalations with this list and php matched and I used it right away.

- There, I got the root and the hidden Flag as well, along with that I even got hte
