- We started with the Nmap scan and we find the ports open which are port 80 the apache server (debian), 2049 nfs (Network File System) and port 8080 with an apache server.
- As there are two apache servers with different ports we start the FuFF scan for both of them individually.
- Until those scans were going on we use mount and file a zip file named save.zip
- It was password protected so we crack the password with the use of fcrackzip.
- There we find 2 files, one is a text file and another is a id_rsa.
- We open the todo.txt and find out the initials of a person JP.
- We try to use the id_rsa but we dont have the password yet.
- Now the Scans are complete and we find a few directories .
- From the server with port 8080 we find the list of Users using this url:

- And from the another one we find a file name config.yml

- From there we found a password

- We found both the name and the password so we will try using the id_rsa.

- From here we find out that the sudo zip permissions are enabled so we use that to our advantage to gain the root privileges.

- And there we go we get the root access and we found the flag as well.
